description: Jose visits Germany to look for grant opportunities.
---


Jose is in Potsdam Germany to look for grant opportunities after we failed to get the grant from either DOST or Quezon City. 

He took photos of the food prices there to see how bad inflation is in Germany. This helps understand why the German government collapsed last year.

This is why we are pushing for moneyless circular economy interventions to reduce food inflation while increasing employment.
